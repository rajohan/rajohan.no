        Why choose me?

    There are many benefits to working with a freelance web developer. 
    When I’m working on a project, I’ll be the main point of contact at all times avoiding any communication delays that might occur with larger companies.
    <br><br>
    I have an unfair advantage over most of the competition when it comes to prices. 
    While they need to pay for their office, their staff, their advertising and many other business expenses. I don’t. 
    Which means you avoid paying large overheads. 
    By choosing me, you can be sure that you’re only paying for your website, and not the company picnic.
    <br><br>
    I can complete your project at a rapid pace &ndash; in less time than the typical bureaucratic company can. 
    Most design agencies can take months to build a website for you. 
    Meanwhile, you are missing out on customer orders, website traffic, search engine indexing, and greater visibility on the web from social media links to your website.
